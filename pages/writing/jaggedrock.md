# Jagged Rock
Upon an island battered in equal parts by the grey sea and forever shrieking wind of the northern coast of Ysgr, lies a fortress. It is by all accounts a massive ugly black thing built of the same stone that juts from the surrounding ocean like the cracked teeth of an enormous dragon long drowned. Perhaps in an effort to counterpoint the monochromatic landscape the elements themselves seem to be in an eternal war giving rise to some of the worst conditions any Khudani mariner could hope to survive. Here water and air had been thrashing against each other and hurling themselves at defiant stone for a million years and would continue to do so for a million years more.  The weather however,  was typical for the northern coast of Ysgr and only contributed to a feeling of endless brutal landscape where nature would forever remain untamed. But of course, there were those who would try anyway. 

Orcs had lived among the spraying salt and shifting sea ice even before the first halfling ships had landed in Khudan and it was Orcs who had fought against the Tadrosi when the first walls on the island of Uglak were erected.  Even now, if it weren’t for the purple, gold and crimson flags adorning it, the castle would be easily overlooked: another black slash across a canvas of gray and white.   Even still the troops garrisoned at  the fortress referred to the castle as "The blackest hole on the blackest island in the blackest sea” though the myriad islands of equally black countenance really made it a matter of opinion.

Originally the island was established as a resupply port en route to the more profitable and safe harbors of the west coast but  the constant raids by orcish tribes meant that a more secure option would be needed so half a century ago the Magi announced the construction of a fort on Uglak . Now the installation held hundreds of Tadrosi soldiers that had to be constantly resupplied and rotated. Being stationed at Uglak was widely seen as the worst possible assignment but of course the fort's prisoners had it worse but their opinions on the matter were not voiced as often.

Some knew that protection of tadrosi trade was a convenient excuse. In truth, this location was terribly suited to this purpose. It's steep sides made building a dock incredibly difficult let alone any other structure. Stairs had to be carved out of the sheer cliff face just to get to the top of the desolate  island. The weather was horrible and the position of the island relative to prevailing winds and currents meant there were no safe harbors that could be reliably accessed. And yet there were thousands of islands along the Ysgr coast this one had been selected for a reason. Though some knew the island's nominal purpose was a farce, far fewer knew that the real reason for its construction was the discovery of a locus in the heart of the island.  indeed, the locus may have explained some of the unrelenting weather, why the island was regarded as sacred by the native orcs, and why these same orcs were willing to wage an endless guerilla war to remove the garrison.  Some of those few were those same orcs many of which were rotting in the dungeons below the castle.

One such prisoner was Yzra; an average sized Orc woman (making her well above human height) with a dark evergreen-gray skin tone, black dreadlocks, and black eyes.  Those familiar with orcish  traditional tatoos may have recognized her as a member of the broken arrow tribe as well as a ranger, a warrior, and a shaman in that order. Those unfamiliar would still be amazed at the artistry, intricacy, and extent of the work. For her part Yzra spent most of her time thinking. Today She wondered how many waves had crashed against the island’s flanks and how many more it would take to bring it down. She watched through the bars as the boiling waves thundered into the rocks with desperate fury sending spray into the air where it hung until it froze on the rocks. She wondered if she too had struggled in vain only to one day lie cold and still. She wondered if she would have continued forward if she had been told that her unit would be captured and Mduzur would be taken from her.

"These dogs are on sacred land!" Yzra thought. Surely, the ancestors would guide her or those that would free her, and she would be able to fight again. Still she had been waiting for years now and though her connection to the spirits felt stronger than ever, her once toned musculature was long gone. She wouldn’t be able to fight physically, at least not very effectively. For what must have been the thousandth time Yzra wondered where her friends were held. How many had survived ? Would they be in this prison as well? Why hadn’t the tadrosi soldiers killed or bargained us away yet?

When she was able to calm her anger, Yzra could reach out and feel that Mduzur was alive but had no idea where he was. Of course, this led to more questions: Had he been sold to a collector, put on the front lines of some distant battlefield, or had they put him to work or in the fighting pits? Thinking of her companion always hurt the most; the bond between a spirit warrior and their animal guide was intense and despite his size and ferocity, Mduzur was a beautiful soul filled with patience, kindness, and wisdom.

Anger flared Yzra; anger at Tadros, anger at the scout that had betrayed them, and anger at herself for allowing herself to be captured and her inability to do anything about it. Yzra was so buried in her misery that she almost didn’t notice when the lock clicked, and the rusty hinges croaked as the door opened lazily.
