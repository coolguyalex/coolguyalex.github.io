## Kudahros and the Kudahr Field
#### Alar Shay,  M.A.P. Department of Arcanics,  Ulangatun Athenaeum
### Abstract
Our Everyday experience  in traditional spacetime (three spatial and single time dimension), tells us that information is stored using Energy and Mass (E-M). Consciousness is an emergent property of information manifesting from particular organizational structures of that same information-- e.g. consciousness carries more information than can be reasonably expected of the underlying E-M and evades understanding through the traditional lenses of natural philosophy, geomancy, and arcanics.
Here we propose that consciousness exists as a dynamic interplay between an extra-dimensional force-field and our traditional , lower-dimensional world. We refer to this extradimensional force as the "Kudahr Field" and elaborate on it's properties and uses.

### The Kudahr Field and Consciousness
The Kudahr field is an extradimensional information field capable of reducing the state inertia of the energy-matter-information trinity: i.e. EMI-flux. Kudahr field interactions with lower-dimensional spacetime are most commonly observed as consciousness: In conscious beings, lower-dimensional E-M (physiology and anatomy) and it's coupled information (neural-network electrochemistry) is organized such that extradimensional information can be "stored" and "retrieved" from the Kudahr field at will. In other words information is organized  in the brain such that the Kudahr field is affected and the Kudahr field in turn effects the E-M-I of the brain.

In this instance, lower-dimensional E-M-I is only effected by the Kudahr force through the conscious thoughts of the sentient being--a limited scope akin to magnets' attractive effect on a smattering of ferromagnetic substances alone. However, sufficiently elevated states of consciousness are able to effectively broaden the Kudahr force reorganizing the E-M-I of lower dimensional spacetime through the Kudahr field.

The Kudahr field is not spread evenly over our lower-dimensional universe and areas of comparatively high EMI-flux (high ambient field strength) are known as Loci. Achieving Kudahr field super-conciousness is seemingly much easier in Loci but more more difficult in field-strength minimum zones.

### Teleportation:
Teleportation involves a total conversion of lower-dimensional E-M-I to Kudahr field super-information in a way which ensures its reconversion back to lower-dimensional E-M-I. This process is intensely difficult and requires an uncommon mastery over the Kudahr field. Because the Kudahr field is extra-dimensional distant points in lower dimensions may be comparatively close in Kudahr-field space and proximate lower-dimensional points may be separated by unknown distances in Kudahr field space.

​Three factors govern the difficulty of teleportation. 1. The proximity of the point in traditional space-time. 2. The ambient Kudahr-field strength at the point of departure and arrival. 3. the familiarity with the location and it's proximal Kudahr field E-M-I flux patterns.
