## **Humans (Umani)**
### Overview 
Humans are a highly varied and adaptable race. Humans can be found in all corners of Kudahn in a myriad of cultures and societies.
### Dispersal
Continent-wide 
### History
An active discourse surrounds the most ancient of the “Old Species" (humans, halflings, elves, dwarves, and gnomes) with humans generally considered the most likley contender but halflings finding wide support as well. The importance of answering such questions is primarily fueled by the widely accepted theory of species divergence: a postulated divergence of all the "old Species" as descendents of one mother species which was rapidly altered and dispersed during the cataclysmic "Undoing". Scholarly consensus places the arrival of humans roughly twenty-thousand years ago. 
### Relations
Initial human settlements found the "New Races": goblins and orcs well established on the continent. Relations were initially amicable, but over centuries competition, disease, and migration patterns pushed native goblinoids into the margins. After the cataclysm known as "the Undoing" and the Ysgr conquests, human populations and settlements ar ehtought to have been massivley reduced. 
### Cultures
Human societies resist generalization; they span democracies to tyrannies, polytheists to atheists, liberated to authoritarian. Their only constants are adaptability, resourcefulness, and historically high birth rates—now finally slowing.

## **Elves (Ko’lantani)**
Tall, lithe, and densely muscled, the Ko’lantani are thought to be the first lineage to diverge from humans, giving them the longest time to develop distinct cultures, physiologies, and lifeways. When humans left their ancestral homeland, the elves remained for thousands of years, only later immigrating to Khūdan—where they found kinship with orcs and tension with humans. Elven society remains tribal and deeply tied to nature, with arch-druids guiding groups up to 10,000. Their spirituality centers on primordial gods and two major avatars: **Illūs**, the personification of elven-kind, and **K’naru**, the spirit of the wilds. Though rarely united, elven clerics travel broadly to maintain cultural continuity across scattered tribes.

## **Dwarves (Gūndan)**
Shorter than humans but massively built, the Gūndan are believed to be the closest of the old races to humankind and can interbreed with them. Culturally, however, they could not be more different. Dwarven society is rigorously ordered, perfection-driven, communal, and disciplined—producing the world’s finest engineers, architects, masons, endurance athletes, and game-players. Individualism is discouraged in favor of shared purpose, and dwarves judge themselves harshly through the quality of their craft. Their technologies and techniques are unmatched, though their conservatism often slows adoption of new innovations.

## **Gnomes**
A subspecies of dwarf, gnomes are shorter, longer-haired, and dramatically more expressive. Rejecting what they view as dwarven authoritarianism, gnomish societies prize liberty, creativity, and merit above all else. Their neighborhoods—often embedded inside greater dwarven or human cities—are hubs of mathematics, banking, construction, invention, art, and scientific rigor. Their mixture of obsessive focus and flamboyant expression makes them natural collaborators with goblins, with whom they often live (though they cannot produce offspring). Gnomes can interbreed with humans, dwarves, and halflings, adding to their cosmopolitan reputation.

## **Halflings**
A small-statured people of debated origin—possibly derived from gnomes, dwarves, or humans—halflings maintain strong cultural identity despite few independent settlements. Curious, clever, and intuitively attuned to the world, halflings cherish hospitality, food, storytelling, and craftsmanship. Many of the greatest chefs, vintners, musicians, and artisan-guilds across Khūdan are halfling-run. Though they dislike war, halflings are surprisingly resilient and longer-lived than most humans, and when threatened, they fight with unexpected ferocity. They readily integrate into human, gnomish, or dwarven societies.

## **Orcs**
Among the first inhabitants of Khūdan, orcs (alongside goblins) form the core of what scholars call the “New Races.” Spread across every nation, orcs prefer self-governed, fortified settlements, thriving in tundra, desert, jungle, or sea. Their culture is strongly traditional, emphasizing family, honor, legacy, and the **Four Primordials**. Renowned as warriors, knights, samurai, and mercenaries, orcs were instrumental in halting Andor’s expansion and play a vital role in naval traditions—many captains consider an orcless ship doomed. Physically imposing, thick-haired, and often tattooed with achievements deemed worthy by master-artists, they blend martial, spiritual, and communal values.

## **Goblins**
Small, wiry, and astonishingly adaptable, goblins have the widest cultural diversity of any people in Khūdan—from sophisticated city-states with libraries and schools to feral nomadic tribes with no written history. Fossil evidence suggests goblins were the **first** intelligent inhabitants of the continent, with a branch eventually evolving into orcs. Goblin art is wild, expressive, and unpredictable; goblin tactics even more so, making any fight with them dangerously inventive. Though pushed into harsher lands by human expansion, goblins have also integrated into nearly every society with surprising ease. Resourcefulness and creativity are their defining traits.
