# DM wisdom

## Edariad
a person's sense of self is a consequence of the accumulation of self descriptive narrative elements. to invest players in their characters, they need to make choices which help them define their character, choices with weight and one of the easiest ways to do this is with moral dellemas which test their philosphocal positions: to pit their reason against their emotion.
