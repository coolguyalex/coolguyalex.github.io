# DM wisdom

## Edariad
A person's sense of self is a consequence of the accumulation of self descriptive narrative elements. to invest players in their characters, they need to make choices which help them define their character, choices with weight and one of the easiest ways to do this is with moral dellemas which test their philosphocal positions: to pit their reason against their emotion.

## Dadi 
Draw players into exploration by using "the highlighted room". Describe things in a space in a way that draws in your players and makes them want to investigate. Use the senses. Stick to about three things. If you need more things then nest them within descriptions.
