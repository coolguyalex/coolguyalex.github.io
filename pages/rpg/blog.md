## Hex Exploration
One of the goals of Black Cloaks is to run fun overland exploration. 
I have had this in my head for many years probably at least since a mountain climb in NH 10 years ago where I imagined successfully communicating the joy of the endeavor to players areound a table. 
It may be that the medium of TTRPG's is ill-suited to something that derives much of its pleasure from the physicality of it all but I think there are enough gam-y aspects to hiking, navigating, and survival to work in video games so why not in TTRPG's

For a time I worked on an entire game system - sort of a hybrid board game / RPG which took many of it's notes from the famous (and perhaps famously bad) 'overland survival'.
This system ended uyp being abandonded and buried somewhere under pixel dust of some deep folder in google drive as the problem of system creep (for which i must remain eternally vigilant) reared its head.
