The Black Cloaks began as a guild of scholars, cartographers, archaeologists, and dungeoneers that  sought out the ruins of ancient civilizations, sunken treasure galleons, and the burial hordes of ancient kings for knowledge, profit, and fame. 
In time, the black cloaks became respected and feared in equal measure and at their height, the black cloaks were the consult and trade partners of kings, archmages, and warlords alike. 
However, as their power grew, so too did their enemies: borders were closed to their passing, information once freely provided now came with conditions or not at all, and kingdoms began to lay claim to the wealth and artifacts that the Black Cloaks had obtained. 
Laws were passed against “Black-Cloaking” to be punishable as thievery or grave-robbing. 
Thus, the opportunities with which the guild was left became increasingly remote and dangerous: the oceans to cross were wider and dungeons deeper darker. 

Today the Black Cloaks are composed of a venerable old guard and an increasingly desperate or daring lot of recruits that show up green in the spring and are usually dead by winter.
It is said now that only the truly pathetic, insane, or foolish mantle the black cloak willingly. 
Many rulers have even made a habit of forcing conscription to the guild hoping the ne’er do well might strike it rich and pay back their debts, make something of themselves, or die in some far off land and spare them the trouble. 

So… what type of lowly misbegotten spawn are you? 
A debtor, a criminal, a deserter, an urchin left to die in the gutter, or perhaps an innocent dreamer with their nose so deep in a book they didn’t realize how far following their research would take them. 
You’ll be transported to an island on the northern edge of the sea of bones known to the Gr and the Munaerwyn as Anorak, to the Dorani: Daggyrogg, and the locals: Marea. 
You can pick whichever you like, either way it’s your home now. 
Try to avoid making it your grave.
