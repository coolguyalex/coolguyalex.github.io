# Black Cloaks Lore
---

## Origins
Kudahn is vast and ancient and with patience, intelligence, and grit the Black Cloaks have uncovered the artifacts, treasure, and secrets entombed in the ruins of fallen civilizations. We are a guild of scholars, cartographers, archaeologists, and dungeoneers who take an oath to illuminate the darkness and to uphold our brethren. 
At first the Black Cloaks were considered heroes. Kings and archmagi traveled as far as Gundarkyvos and Dugarsivan to speak to our elders but as our power and influence grew so to did our enemies. The jealous of the powerful meant that soon borders were closed to our passing, information now came with the expectation of recompense, and sovreigns began to lay claim to the wealth and artifacts that the Black Cloaks had obtained claiming it their inheritance. Some considered Black Cloaks no different from thieves or grave-robbers and began trying and sentencing our brethren. 
And so it was that the opportunities with which the guild was left became increasingly remote and dangerous: the oceans to cross were wider and dungeons deeper and darker. 

Despite the dangers new recruits show up every spring hoping to make a name for themselves, strike it rich, or finally discover the answers to questions they have long held close to their hearts. Many find what they are seeking in the darkness but many more never come out. The dangers are difficult to overstate and I have lost count of the number of Black Cloaks that have been stabbed, sliced, maimed, crushed, eaten, poisoned, starved, dessicated, burned, drowned, entombed, envenomated, defenestrated, annd otherwise killed. Consider yourself warned. The world of Kudahn is vast and ancient. People, Religions, and Empires have risen and fallen manny times over in the tens of thousands of years that the Zidani scholars have been able to trace it's history back. The only thing for sure is that the you will be traveling farther and delvinng deeper than anyone to find out the continet's secrets.
