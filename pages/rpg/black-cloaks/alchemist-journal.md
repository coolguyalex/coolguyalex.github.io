LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. I — “On Herbs, Healing, and the Memory of Grandmother Eryndra”

Entry 1
I return again to the memories that shaped me. When I was but seven winters old, fever ravaged my body, burning me hollow. Grandmother Eryndra refused the city physicians and instead gathered stems, roots, and strange blue fungi that grew only on the northern cliffs. She brewed a bitter draught, singing quietly as she worked.
I lived.
She saved dozens more over the years—children dying of lungrot, elders swallowed by ague—all with herbs and fungal tinctures she prepared by feel rather than formula.
My life began in her cottage, surrounded by the scent of boiling sap and drying spores. All my learning, all my scholarship, is merely an echo of her intuition.

Entry 3
Plants and fungi are archives of forgotten cures. They do not fight; they transform. Their medicines shift matter and mind with a gentleness steel cannot mimic. I have sworn that I will dedicate my career to these subtle sciences. Let my colleagues chase pyromantic spectacle—my answers lie in the quiet kingdom beneath our feet.

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. II — “Kudahros: The Miracle Crystal”

Entry 12
My fascination has shifted to the crystalline lattices known as Kudahros, rumored for centuries in Tadrosi pharmacological texts. The fragments I smuggled from a closed collection show subtle pulsing at the microscale, oscillations unlike any mineral I have studied. Local folklore attributes this to “Kudahr flux”—some natural particle field bleeding through hidden layers of reality.
I doubt the folklore, but the phenomenon is real.

Entry 14
Refinement remains difficult. The Tadrosi guard their method with absolute fanaticism. However, through iterative acid-washes and careful exposure to herbal catalysts, I have achieved a primitive distillation. The resulting crystal glows faintly and generates measurable energetic differentials.
This energy is clean, silent, and astonishingly efficient.

Entry 17 — Conference Notes (Gundarkyvos Academy)
My presentation was met first with applause, then with whispers. Several administrators left abruptly. I should have recognized their insignia—Tadrosi agents embedded in the Academy’s administrative faculty.
By dusk I was stripped of my post.
By dawn my laboratory key no longer functioned.
They fear discovery. They fear the loss of monopoly.
They fear what I have made without their blessing.

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. III — “The Dorani Contract”

Entry 21
The Dorani Military Science Directorate has extended an offer: unlimited resources, no oversight by the Academy, and full autonomy over my Kudahros research. I accept reluctantly. I want only the freedom to pursue truth.

Entry 24
The machines they now build from my designs—“Kudahros Engine Constructs”—are not tools but husks into which they pour obedience. They move with perfect silence, perfect compliance.
I watched one tear open a reinforced gate as easily as splitting fruit.
Is this what my grandmother dreamed for me?

Entry 27
I requested dismissal today. The Directorate refused.
“Your work is too valuable,” they said.
What they meant was: We will kill you if you stop.

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. IV — “Deployment & Escape”

Entry 33
Assigned to Munar to supervise the Automaton Division. The soldiers here treat me as if I were part of the machines I built—an accessory, a device.
I have reprogrammed a small group of automata to obey only my personal cylinders. If I am to leave this place alive, they will be my escort.

Entry 35 — Final Military Entry
Tonight we slipped away into the hills beneath a moonless sky. My automata followed without question.
I am free.
But to what end?

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. V — “The Biological Turn”

Entry 40
Survival requires adaptation. The forests here are rich but hostile. My automata gather what food they can, yet I am drawn again to biological sciences—not for healing now, but for sustenance, transformation, efficiency.
Plants and animals bend readily under chemical coercion.
But fungi… fungi defy all expectation.

Entry 43
Discovered a strange fungus today. It does not rot or feed in the traditional sense—it incorporates. Living tissue, dead tissue, it matters not. The fungus infiltrates, alters, and then directs the host.
These infected creatures wander not mindlessly, but purposefully, as if guided by a single distant thought.

I followed its growth deeper into a cavern that spirals endlessly downward. The deeper I went, the more the fungus pulsed with a rhythm that did not belong to this world.

Entry 44
I write this with a trembling hand.
There is something in that cavern.
A horror of shape and shadow and impossible geometry. My automata seized me and dragged me back to safety before I could be touched.
I will not return.

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. VI — “Reagents & Mind Override”

Entry 50
Through trial I have discovered that the fungus responds to certain alchemical catalysts. I refer to them as Reagent K, Reagent VI, Reagent Vb, etc.
These reagents do not suppress the fungus; rather, they misdirect it. They allow me to nudge the infected will, to steer its instincts.
Temporarily, at least.

Entry 53
Infected creatures retain their memories, yet their agency is suppressed beneath the fungal directive.
What intelligence could orchestrate such unity across countless bodies?

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. VII — “The Myconid Trials”

Entry 57
A group of wandering elves approached my campfire seeking shelter and food. I fed them a broth infused with Reagent VI and a diluted sample of the fungal matrix.
Their transformation was not what I expected.

Instead of becoming slaves to the fungal will, the alchemical interference dulled their minds.
They became docile, curious, unburdened by complexity. Childlike.

Their bodies sprouted pale ridges and soft caps. Their gait slowed. Their speech fragmented into simple, earnest phrases.
They are… charming. Innocent.
I have named them myconids.

LAB NOTEBOOK: VOL. VIII — “The Black Cloaks”

Entry 61
Intruders. A company of Black Cloaks followed old trails and stumbled into my outer chambers. Their leader recognized my automata and attacked with commendable ferocity.
I subdued them with aerosols of Reagent Vb.
They now rest in containment pods of my own design. Their resilience makes them promising subjects.

Entry 63
The outer lair is compromised. I will abandon it. I have found a deeper chamber near the mouth of the great fungal abyss—a place the Black Cloaks will not think to search again.
There, in true darkness, I will continue my work.
There, I will be undisturbed.
There, at last, I will understand the intelligence beneath the mycelium.
