## Primordial Worship
Between the cities and deserts among the sagebrush and scrublands of the east live the practitioners of the oldest religion in Tadros and potentially the continent. Practitioners believe that the energy of the primordials is thought to suffuse all of nature. Primordialists see the entirely of creation as being literally comprised of the four essences. To primordialists the dualism of Ngan-Shair and magic-focus of Kūdism seem overly simplistic.
​Whether Primordial worship was brought to Kudahn from across the Iboro Sea or evolved from the goblinoid animism (and thus is more ancient) is an on-going topic of research but similarities abound. However, the ancestor worship and emphasis on spirits and ever conscious entities is rejected in place of a more physical understanding of the universe. The primoridials are:
### Ur
Domain of solids, earth,  mountains, strength, tradition, death, family, winter. Simply symbolized by a circle symbolizing stone or more complexly represented by concentric circles. 
### ​​Eloa
Domain of the ocean, change, tranquility, rebirth, inspiration, growth, spring . Symbolized by a wave and more complexly by vast interlocking patterns.
### Aea
Doman of the sky; gasses, freedom, weather, fall,  art, creativity, Simply Symbolized by a gust of wind and more complexly represented by swirling chaotic patterns that never repeat
### Shaír
God of passion, fire, poetry, sex, love, anger, light, the sun: Simple symbol is a triangle more complex symbols: red disc surrounded by orange flames

## Illūs
Illusi are common in the north, northeast and east of Doran where elves and humans historically intermingled. Practiced by widely among the elves and the ancestral Dorani.
Those that believe in the dream of Illūs believe that through meditation and deliberate action ones soul may be brought closer to true peace. If enough souls are brought to peace then the entire planet may reach perfect balance. Illus represents a state of true understanding which permeates all beings. A state of mind which is unshakable in its serenity. Named after an ancient elf: Illusani- thought to have gathered a host of humans and the elves brought them to the mountains and revealed her understanding. True neutral- like Nature, Illus represents the natural rhythm of life, seasons, and the circle of life and death. Believes that there is no meaning of life and all beings should simply be.  Conscious beings should strive for tranquility and contentment.  All beings have spirits which are constantly recycled back into the earth and newborn creatures at random like nutrients. An individual is a simple vessel which holds a temporary sentience. The goals of the Illusi is to do as little harm as possible to the world around them and help others to achieve tranquility. They are often criticized as too passive or impractical. Illusi are not enterprising or nation building. Illusi are not defenders as they see the loss of innocents or injustice as an eddy in a great cosmic river. 

## The Divine Family
Worship of a family of gods comprised of two parents and two children is common in the western portion of the central shield of Khudan. The family represents all the virtues of mankind in different forms. Each god embodies particular virtues but does not necessarily establish  the ideal form of that particular age or gender. By splitting the ideals, amongst four beings the divine family acts as a symbolic statement that no being (even gods) can contain all virtues and that many virtues can become  vices when taken to extremes. 
In the tradition of the divine family the universe, celestial bodies, and life forms are seen as eternal, existing without beginning or end. The family is said to live amongst the celestial bodies with which they are associated making visits to earth when needed. Though many believe in their physical existence and domain over reality, the divine family also constitute characters in hundreds of folk tales and thus are an important component of everyday life both in and out of these enclaves of steadfast belief. Often the divine family interacts with “Demons” these creatures are typically humanoid but can also manifest as animals and more abstract concepts. The term demon does not connote an evil disposition but rather a minor deity which often serves to counterpoint one of the families virtues or extract a family members vices. Sometimes demons represent forces of nature, luck, or some other unexplained phenomenon. 
This is a simplified representation of the most common modes of worship of the divine family however, the expansion of humanity throughout the central Khudan shield has left many ethnic groups to adapt and alter the faith and numerous splinter traditions have arisen. Some have developed traditions focused on the worship of particular family members and relegating other family members to the status of demons. Others have elevated particular demons to deity status or developed entire faiths focused on a single entity.  
A variation of the divine family popular in the northeast integrates the four deities into primordial worship by viewing the four family members as anthropomorphic avatars of the four primordials. This is likely from cultural integration with Orcs and to a lesser extent elves, among the mountains. Scholars point to the numerous similarities between the divine family and the primordial four as evidence for a common ancestor. These scholars also name this religion among the oldest in Andor.

## Kūdism
​is a monotheistic religion focused on magic (Kūdahros). Khidists believe that magic is likely a sentient force and the creator of the cosmos. Unlike many other religions, anthropomorphizing Kūdahros is almost never done and considered absurd if not disrespectful.
Kūdahros is thought to exist on another plane or series of dimensions -- in a way that is incomprehensible to the standard conscious mind. The deeply faithful often use herbal or arcane psychedelics and other stimulants to reach heightened states of understanding and glimpse the mind of god. Among these people a touch of madness is often considered a gift. Unlike other religions Kudists believe that the more magic is practiced and utilized the more connected to Kūdahros the individual grows and in turn the more powerful Kūdahros grows. It is believed that most magic in the universe is contained, locked-away, and inert. Freeing this energy hastens the universes destiny to be composed purely of arcane energy.
To Kūdists there is nothing more divine than pure magical energy known as Kūdahros but it is believed that magic infuses everything. Practicing magic is akin to prayer and the most powerful wielders of Kūdahros are venerated and revered. Kūdists are concentrated in cities and the coast of Tadros and Oso is their most important city.

## Ngana-Shaír
is a Dualist religion concentrated in the deserts of Tadros. Ngana-Shaír is thought to be an evolution of Orcish style animism brought east and south from across the mountains and applied to desert life. This religion focuses on the interplay of fire and water. These elements are seen in nearly all of life's dualities: the sun and the moon, drought and rain, day and night. Passion, and restraint, action and patience, emotion and logic.
There are many demi-gods and demons and all are thought to exist as part of the dichotomy of fire and water. Although some demi-gods are explicitly evil or good most of the conflict that the gods and man face is a consequence of the contrasting desires of the two halves. Thus, conflicts amongst conscious beings are often viewed through this lens.

## Ærodynites
Ærodyn (AIR-oh-din). 
Long ago some say as many as 2,000 years ago when the wars between Munar and Ysgr were in full swing there was a great warlord from a line of famous warriors known as Ærodyn son of son of Ærod. The Orcish armies would cross the northwest sea and flood the shores of Munar, sacking villages and laying waste to the people. They claimed that the land was stolen from them but the Munari believed they had always been here. Thus the wars continued. Every fall the Orcs would stream south from their frozen homes in search of arable land. After a successful battle defending their homes Ærodyn led the Munari across the sea to strike back at the Orcs. He found their frozen miserable villages tucked between the thorny lines and mountain caves and moved from one to another burning  them until the army needed rest. But during their rest the Orcs mounted a counterattack that overwhelmed the Munari. Ærodyn had never imagined so many Orcs could even survive in such a harsh environment. The Munari were obliterated and the entire army lost. Ærodyn woke  half frozen and covered in blood. He walked through the fields of the dead to his ship and set sail back home. But upon reaching Munar he found the Orcs had raided the mainland in his absence and taken everything. 
In a fit of despair Ærodyn entered the forest with no equipment or food intended to die at nature’s hand. He found a grove of red maple and sat to meditate until he faded from this life. It’s unknown how long he remained in this state but it is said that at some point in half-mad, half-starved stupor Ærodyn ate the trees bark and leaves and fungus growing on the trunk. 
It is said that Ærodyn came to understand his utter meaninglessness. He saw nature and the cosmos unclouded by the self. He saw all matter, all life, and all consciousness as waves in an endless ocean: minds and realities constantly surfacing and being reabsorbed. 
When he awoke he began carving his revelations on nearby stones and kept carving until his dying breath. It is said that animals would visit the site and continue his work and some believe that Ærodyn was able to transfer his consciousness to bears and raccoons. Now on the solstice and equinox it is said that those with minds unclouded by untruth may beseech him for guidance. And the stones he carved have been formed into a large temple around the red maple grove. 
However the incursions of Andor made it necessary to hide the temples location to protect it and the last confidant was killed over 60 years ago. 

## Ysgr Animism
Ysgr have many scattered traditions with aspects unique to each clan however in most cases all creatures and some forces of nature or natural structures like mountains, rivers, or forests are though to have spirits. Some benevolent and some malignant. The spirits of Ancestors are especially important as they can communicate more easily with living creatures. The spirit world is seen as equal to the material world but difficult to access for many. As spirits in the spirit world age they become increasingly less conscious and more abstract until they become pure energy which can only reassemble under extreme circumstances or by combining with other spirits will. Some spirits may have such a powerful force of will that they are thought to endure much longer or recruit others to their cause. 
​
Most Ysgr Animists believe that fear is the root of all evil and fear stems from spiritual ignorance. Thus eliminating fear,  understanding the mind, and the natural world will lead to peace for your spirit and prevent it from fearfully wandering the world. As a result, priests are often warriors as well. The spirits and material beings are in an eternal cycle. The sprint world of accepted newly liberated spirits which have died and then injects them into newborns again. Adherents believe that there is a finite quantity of energy in the world and therefore a finite number of living beings which can occupy it. Throwing the world out of balance could cause permanent damage to this balance or create a new balance. They even ice that different worlds have existed where spirits were dominant or much less energy was available. 


## Huuna
The southern islands contain myriad religious traditions. One of the largest is called ”Huuna” Meaning truth in Yagkuuna (a major language of the Aongh). The Huuna creation myth follows: Two primary gods Raurani and Gulanu’u were a single entity of pure energy that were split at the formation of the universe. Many other such beings exist but they are scattered throughout the skies as stars now. Raurani was furious at the split and became so angry that he created lava. As his anger cooled it transformed to solid acceptance forming land. Gulang’u cried instead and his tears created the oceans themselves. Where his tears met Raurani's hot land steam was formed. Raurani collected the steam to make the sky. Gulanu'u spent untold time creating the many creatures and plants of the sea to take distract him from the sadness of his split but Raurani breathed life into them by channeling his passion into Gulang’u’s work. Overtime the creatures transitioned to land. Eventually the brothers decided that they should allow their creations to roam freely and the brothers would watch from their new sky home becoming the sun and moon. The sun would continue to influence life and the moon would control the oceans.
Raurani- volcano god considered responsible for land, time, the sky, and giving life. 
Gulang’u - whale god and creator of the sea, sculptor of all lifeforms starting in the sea.

## Ulunism
Common goblin Religion with an entire Pantheon of Gods primarily associated with nature. Thought to be descended from Huuna since chief among these gods are the moon and sun. However unlike Huuna the moon is often given a male aspect and the Sun a female aspect. Goblin society is often matriarchal, reflected by the divine organization chief sun goddess and her husband the moon god. 

## Zidatan Agnosticism
A practically agnostic religion of Zidan. The people of Zidan content that a god may have created the cosmos but make no claim to have any idea about what sort of god this might be, why they would do such a thing, The Zidatan believe that if a being was capable of creating the cosmos it is so unimaginably powerful that it's desires are likley completely unknowable and we most likley matter very little to it thus, whether we worship it or not is likley immaterial.
