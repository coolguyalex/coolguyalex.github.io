# Embedded Electronics 

## Goblinoid Dungeon Mastering System *pocket*
Inspirational fantasy companion.
GDMS-*pocket* is an easy-to-use, minimal, and customizable system that DMs and creators can use alone or at the game table.
Inspired by random tables and generators, GDMS-*pocket* wants to guve you an NPC name when you need it but get out of the way when you don't. 

## Music Friend 
A virtual pet and mix-tape sharing system that rewards you for making custom recorded mixes by growing your digital audiophile hatchling. 
Music friend lets you record audio by acting as a bluetooth sink (and source), audio input jacks, and an on-board microphone. 
Add your recordings to playslists to create mixes to share with your friends.
Every recording you make, tag you edit, and playlist you share adds to your pet as it grows. 

#AudioSnap Box — two‑way song voicemail
A small tabletop device (one at your place, one at your parents’ place) that acts like a **Snapchat-for-audio**:
- You **record or import** a song/audio clip (via Bluetooth audio *or* line‑in).
- You optionally record a short **intro voice message** (“Hi mom…”) using an onboard mic.
- The device **packages** the intro + main audio into a single “message” and **sends it over the internet** to the paired device.
- The receiver shows **“New message”** on a tiny screen; a button plays it back (intro first, then the song).
- Messages are stored on **microSD** and can auto‑expire (optional), keeping the “surprise capsule” vibe.

This avoids the “record system audio from a phone app” problem: the device records **what you feed it** (analog line‑in or Bluetooth receiver), then sends the resulting file.

## Brain builder 
Imagine a picture book that never ends and adjusts to your child's learning. 
Brain builder contains thousands of words, images, sounds, and concepts to show your childs developing mind the world. 
Brain builder leverages child pstchology and development and the idea of Spaced Repition Algorithms (SRS) to display novel content when it makes the most sense. 

## Ambient Sound Systems 
Sculptures that generate ever-changing musical tapestries. 
Ambient engines fueled by sensory data turn the environment into musoc.

## Binary Clock 
A clock designed to teach people binary. Lights turn on and off based on the current time. Each row of the system corresponds to a digit of the time. HHMMSS and each column corresponds to a numeric place. 
e.g. 
13:45:30

|   |2^3|2^2|2^1|2^0|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H |   |   | 0 | 1 |
| M |   |   | 1 | 1 |
| M | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| S |   | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| S | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
